# Brazilian Postcode Lookup Project

## Overview

This project is a .NET 7 application that leverages the Refit library to interact with the public API provided by [ViaCEP](https://viacep.com.br/). The primary goal is to perform postcode (CEP) lookups in Brazil.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET 7:** The project is developed using the latest version of the .NET platform.

- **Refit:** Refit is used to define and consume RESTful APIs in a type-safe way, simplifying the integration with external services.

- **ViaCEP API:** The application relies on the public API provided by ViaCEP to fetch detailed information based on Brazilian postcodes.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/seu-repositorio.git
   cd seu-repositorio

2. **Run the Application**
   ``` bash
   dotnet run

## Configuration

If needed, you can adjust the configuration settings in the project to suit your requirements. Look for configuration files or settings related to the ViaCEP API and Refit integration.
